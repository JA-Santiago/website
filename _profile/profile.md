I am the youngest of five children. My mom is a single parent and we barely make enough money to survive. But thanks to my sister, I was able to go up until senior high school. Meanwhile, I continue to acquire knowledge through online resources and courses. 

As someone who grew up in one of the poor areas in Metro Manila, I thought I had no chance to be somebody. Most people there are nobodiesâ€“ including myself.  It was
until the Covid-19 pandemic came in 2020, I got the opportunity to be with someone completely opposite from the people I have been with for 18 years. He thought me a lot of things and made me realize that I have a lot of positive things to contribute to the world. Now, I understand that it does not matter where you came from but it is where you go. That marks the beginning of my path toward becoming a software engineer.
