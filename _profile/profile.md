I am the youngest of five children. As someone who grew up in one of the poorest areas of Metro Manila, I thought I had no chance to be somebody. It was until the Covid-19 pandemic happened in 2020 that I had the opportunity to meet someone who shared with me a completely opposite lifestyle and mentality from what I have known for 18 years. 

I now understand that I have so much more to contribute to the world. It does not matter where you come from, but where you end up going. My goals have been strengthened! I will stay committed! This is the beginning of my journey toward success.
