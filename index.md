### Professional Profile

I would describe myself as an Expert Generalist with skills spanning graphic design, multimedia, web design, project leadership, visual communication, user experience, eLearning, online systems, interface design and information architecture. 

Currently I am the Online Learning Technology Leader at Charles Sturt University, where I've also held a variety of roles relating to the implementation, development and production of eLearning resources and systems. Previous to this I spent a number of years in commercial graphic design, working in a variety of roles in print and marketing in Australia and in Europe.

I have a keen interest in innovation as well as developing and implementing new technologies within an educational context to enhance the learning experience. I believe that technology offers a range of unique opportunities to actualise a range of pedagogical and instructional approaches which can revolutionise the education sector. I love the challenge that new technology brings and the creative process involved in developing an idea through to implementation.

Working at the nexus of technology and education I have developed a skill for translating ideas, concepts and goals into technological solutions that improve the user experience. I am a skilled communicator who works especially hard at being able to translate ‘tech speak’ into something tangible and understandable. 

Always open to new opportunities I have been working to establish a broad and international personal learning network and done this by working in the open, engaging in social media, writing academically, presenting at conferences and blogging extensively. At the same time I have become increasingly fluent with leadership responsibilities, large scale projects and team management. I am poised for further change and growth and ready to seize the next big opportunity.

## Publications

Title: "Metamorphosis and Adaptive Digital Publishing"
Authors: "Rob Stone, Tim Klapdor, Tyswan Slater, Rod Haggith"
Publisher: Ascilite 2013 Conference Proceeding
Date: Nov 2013
Link: http://www.ascilite.org.au/conferences/sydney13/program/papers/Stone.php

This paper aims to explore the conceptual work being undertaken at Charles Sturt University to develop The Adaptive Digital Publishing Engine (TADPOLE). The aim of the project is to envision a distinct way of creating, structuring and publishing educational resources for delivery to a wide variety of platforms and media. The development of TADPOLE will allow us explore a 21st century approach to publishing that embraces digital affordances and uses metamorphosis, rather than translation or transcription, to convert content from one format to another.

Title: "Mobile Learning at Charles Sturt University: Lessons learned from university-wide iPad trials in 2012"
Authors: "Tim Klapdor, Philip Uys"
Publisher: Ascilite 2013 Conference Proceeding
Date: Nov 2013
Link: http://www.ascilite.org.au/conferences/sydney13/program/papers/Klapdor.php

The mLearn Project at Charles Sturt University (CSU) started in 2011 as an initiative to explore mobile learning and its application and potential for the institution. This paper provides a meta-perspective of one particular aspect of the project, a series of university-wide device trials, and describes what took place, the initial findings, discussions related to mobile and the key recommendations from the project. The project has provided a way for the university to explore new technology within its specific and unique learning and teaching contexts. It has provided real world experiences from which to learn and through exploration a better understanding of our present has been reached. This paper is an attempt to share the examples and experiences and provide a basis to imagine our future direction.

Title: "Conducting and Reporting on Educational Technology Research for Institutional Impact"
Authors: "Harriet Ridolfo, Susan Tull, Lynette Nagel, Janette Kruger, Sue Gregory, Tim Klapdor, Philip Uys"
Publisher: Ascilite 2012 Conference Proceeding
Date: Nov 2012
Link: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/234130403_Conducting_and_Reporting_on_Educational_Technology_Research_for_Institutional_Impact

The advance of educational technology coupled with competitive forces, ever-increasing digitisation, and new entrants into the Higher Education sector, has created an environment of constant change for those working within it. This paper discusses how seven people, in five institutions across three countries joined forces to develop their knowledge, skill and ability in conducting and reporting on educational technology research for institutional impact. Reviewed in this paper are a range of approaches adopted across the different institutions, considerations of which of these have been effective and examination of whether targeted communication strategies have helped overcome inherent barriers.

Title: "Mobility makes us agile and lean: A new paradigm for institutional projects"
Authors: "Tim Klapdor"
Ascilite 2012 Conference Proceeding
Date: Nov 2012
Link: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234308095_Mobility_makes_us_agile_and_lean_A_new_paradigm_for_institutional_projects?ev=prf_pub

The mLearn Project at Charles Sturt University (CSU) is an attempt to establish a new philosophy for large-scale institutional initiatives that borrows aspects from the technology companies based out of Silicon Valley. This paper will outline the concepts that have been adopted as well as the rationale for this change in tact. The project is running in 2012 and into 2013 over three teaching sessions and it is hoped will foster innovation through trials of technology, mobilising system access and developing mobile enhanced learning resources. Findings and reflections from the project will be published over the next 18 months.
